<h1>Future Internet Architecture</h1>

<h2>Improving Network Security and Manageability with Virtualization</h2>

Today's Internet architecture imposes constraints that can make network
operations tasks staggeringly difficult.  My research helps
network operators run their networks in the context of today's Internet
routing architecture,
but also explores how the Internet architecture be
changed to facilitate better network operations. I
construe network operations somewhat broadly: in addition to tackling
problems such as helping network operators perform traffic engineering,
improve network security, and provision and deploy new services.  This
research incorporates work both on network architecture and
protocol design.

<p>
In addition to designing tools and techniques to help network operators
run their networks better today, within the contraints of the current
Internet infrastructure, I am also designing and implementing new
network architectures and systems that could help the network be more
inherently robust and secure.  I am investigating how a network
architecture that separates infrastructure providers (the entities that
deploy and maintain the network equipment) from service providers (the
entities that deploy network protocols and end-to-end services). This
separation allows the future Internet to support multiple simultaneous
virtual networks, each of which could offer multiple end-to-end
network services.
