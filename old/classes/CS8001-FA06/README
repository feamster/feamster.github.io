The entries in the calendar are generated automatically from the
description files in the "detail" directory.  The files you care about are:

  index.srhtml -- the template file for the main index page.

  pagebottom.srhtml 
  pagetop.srhtml
  bodyhead.srhtml -- the template files for all .html files

  talk_skel.srhtml -- the template file for the individual talk pages

  detail/*.txt -- the description files for individual seminars

The program "bp.rb" generates all of the detail/*.html files and the
index.html file from the skeletons and description files.

To add a new seminar, just create a "something.txt" file in the detail
directory, and fill it in appropriately.  NOTE: The detail.txt files
are written in YAML, an english-like markup language.  There are a few
peculiarities (google for the entire list):

  * Strings with ":"s in them must be quoted
  * Multi-line things like the abstract and the bio should be specified
    with the | character (e.g., Abstract:  | ) to tell the parser
    to preserve the line breaks.

  * The case of the fields MATTERS.  Specify "Date", not "date", etc.

TODO:
  - Write an automated email generator
    - and make it automatically strip out/translate any HTML
      in the abstract/etc.

CHANGES:

 -  v0.1  2006-01-15  dga   Initial version.
