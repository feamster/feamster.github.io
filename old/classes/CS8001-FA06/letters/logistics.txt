Would you like us to book a room for you, or do you want to handle it
yourself, or fly in and out in the same day?

If you want to grab one yourself, I suggest either the Sunnyledge - 
412-621-9282 - or the Inn on 714 Negley - 421-661-0631.  They're
both bed & breakfast style hotels.  If you'd prefer a conventional
hotel, there's a mariott, wyndham, and holiday inn both fairly
close to CMU.  None of them is particularly outstanding.

If you'd like us to grab one for you, please let me and my assistant,
Barbara Grandillo know, and we'll take care of it.  I've CC:'d Barbara
on this if you just want to mass-reply.

Same question applies to travel from the airport.  If you let us know
when your flights arrive, we'll arrange a car for you (preferred to the
taxis, and a similar price range).  If you'd like to arrange it, the guy
I recommend is Larry Waite of Airport Sedan Service, at 412-401-5466.
It's about 45 minutes to/from the airport under normal conditions.
