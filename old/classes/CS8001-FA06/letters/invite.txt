[intro]

The primary function of this seminar series is to introduce CMU faculty to
new ideas and spark collaborations. The seminar should be on a topic that
interests a broad area of the systems research community. We typically
only hold this seminar a few times each semester and try to attract
well-known faculty and researchers.  (To see a list of past topics and
speakers please visit http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~systems_seminar/ )  
My view of the systems seminar is that it's a chance for us to invite 
stellar people while they're still making serious technical contributions.

("Systems" in this case is defined broadly, and includes core OS, networks,
distributed systems, storage, system security, and a touch of PL.)

Typically, we prefer speakers to spend at least a day at CMU  including
meetings with various faculty and the seminar talk.  The talk is typically
on Monday afternoon.

I'd be delighted if we could get you out here to talk.  Let me know if
you'd be interested, and we can talk figure out the details.  (CMU lets
me pay for your travel and accomodations, but we don't have an honorarium
for this seminar.)
