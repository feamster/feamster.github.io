<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>In this talk, I will present the rationale and evaluation of "transfer service" that performs bulk data transfers on behalf of applications. By writing a single transfer service module, a developer can make new transfer techniques available to all applications on a system, instead of modifying each application independently.  To show the benefit of having these capabilities, I will discuss a new transfer technique that we have implemented, Similarity-Enhanced Transfer (SET), which efficiently exploits sources of similar files to improve the speed of multi-source downloads.</p>
