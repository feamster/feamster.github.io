Abstract: |

  Overlay routing is known to cause undesired instability in a network
  by operating in a selfish manner. The objectives of overlay routing,
  such as optimizing end-to-end latency, are often in conflict with the
  objectives of traffic engineering in the native layer, which is
  concerned about balancing load. In our work, we build on past research
  that has investigated the recurring non-cooperative interaction
  between overlay routing and traffic engineering, and develop
  strategies that improve the routing performance of a particular layer
  with incomplete information about the other layer. In our strategies,
  one layer acts as a "leader" that predicts the "follower's" reaction
  and undertakes countermeasures to prevent future deterioration in
  performance. Specifically, we propose two classes of strategies --
  "friendly" or "hostile" -- for each layer. By simulating under
  different network characteristics, we show that these preemptive
  strategies achieve near-optimal performance for the leader and
  increase the overall stability of the network. Furthermore, we observe
  that the best performance for a particular layer is achieved only when
  the goals of the other layer are completely violated, thereby
  motivating a higher level of selfishness.
