<h3>Speaker Bio</h3>
<p>Hari Balakrishnan is a Professor in the EECS Department and
a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. His research interests is in the area of
networked computer systems. His research spans overlay and
peer-to-peer networks; Internet routing, congestion control, and
architecture; wireless and sensor networks; network security; and
distributed data management. In addition to many widely cited papers,
several systems developed as part of his research are available in the
public domain, and some are in production or commercial use (e.g., the
Cricket location system, the RON and MONET overlay networks, the Chord
distributed hash table, the rcc network checker, the Aurora/Medusa
stream processing engine).</p>

<p>Balakrishnan received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University
of California at Berkeley in 1998 and a B.Tech. from the Indian
Institute of Technology (Madras) in 1993. His honors include an Alfred
P. Sloan Research Fellowship (2002), an NSF CAREER Award (2000), the
ACM doctoral dissertation award for his work on TCP over wireless
networks (1998), and several award-winning papers at various top
conferences and journals, including the IEEE Communication Society's
William R. Bennett Prize (2004). He has also received awards for
excellence in teaching and research at MIT (Spira and Junior Bose
teaching awards, and the Harold Edgerton faculty achievement award).</p>

<p>In 2003, Balakrishnan co-founded StreamBase Systems, the first
commercial stream processing engine. Between 2000 and 2003, he helped
devise the key algorithms for Sandburst Corporation's (acquired by
Broadcom) high-speed network QoS chipset.
