Title:  'Building Better Data Transfers'

Abstract: 
  
  In this talk, I will present the rationale and evaluation of "transfer
  service" that performs bulk data transfers on behalf of applications.
  By writing a single transfer service module, a developer can make new
  transfer techniques available to all applications on a system, instead
  of modifying each application independently.  To show the benefit of
  having these capabilities, I will discuss a new transfer technique
  that we have implemented, Similarity-Enhanced Transfer (SET), which
  efficiently exploits sources of similar files to improve the speed of
  multi-source downloads.
