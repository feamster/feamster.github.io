<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Overlay routing is known to cause undesired instability in a network
by operating in a selfish manner. The objectives of overlay routing,
such as optimizing end-to-end latency, are often in conflict with the
objectives of traffic engineering in the native layer, which is
concerned about balancing load. In our work, we build on past research
that has investigated the recurring non-cooperative interaction
between overlay routing and traffic engineering, and develop
strategies that improve the routing performance of a particular layer
with incomplete information about the other layer. In our strategies,
one layer acts as a "leader" that predicts the "follower's" reaction
and undertakes countermeasures to prevent future deterioration in
performance. Specifically, we propose two classes of strategies --
"friendly" or "hostile" -- for each layer. By simulating under
different network characteristics, we show that these preemptive
strategies achieve near-optimal performance for the leader and
increase the overall stability of the network. Furthermore, we observe
that the best performance for a particular layer is achieved only when
the goals of the other layer are completely violated, thereby
motivating a higher level of selfishness.</p>
