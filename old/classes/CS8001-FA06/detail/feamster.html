<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Users now demand high availability, good end-to-end performance,
strong security, protection from unwanted traffic, and new (often
critical) services from the Internet.  This growing set of
requirements has exposed the current Internet's poor support for
certain functions.  Unfortunately, new network protocols and services
typically face two deployment hurdles, both of which network
virtualization can help surmount.</p>

<p>First, new protocols and services must be thoroughly tested under
realistic scenarios before being deployed, but such rigorous testing
first requires deployment on a real network.  VINI, a virtual network
infrastructure, can help resolve this "deployment deadlock". VINI
allows researchers to evaluate protocols and services in a realistic
environment that also provides a high degree of control over network
conditions.  VINI allows users to define flexible topologies and
experiment with real routing software, traffic, and network events.  I
will discuss VINI's design and implementation and demonstrate an
implementation of VINI on PlanetLab.</p>

<p>Second, a new protocol or service typically requires coordinated
adoption by the Internet's independently administered networks.  This
"coordination constraint" stifles deployment, especially in cases
where no single network benefits by deploying the technology
independent of other networks.  I will describe such an architecture,
Cabo, which uses network virtualization to decouple infrastructure
providers (who manage physical infrastructure) and service providers
(who deploy network protocols and services), and discuss some
associated challenges and opportunities.</p>

<p>This work is joint with Andy Bavier, Jennifer Rexford, Lixin Gao, Mark
Huang, and Larry Peterson.
