<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Despite its tremendous success, the Internet architecture is showing
its age.  Security is weak and the problems are worsening;
availability continues to be a challenge; network management is
complex and expensive; and mobile hosts are difficult to handle.  Yet,
researchers interested in designing new network architectures face an
unfortunate catch-22.  New ideas are not likely to see significant
adoption without evaluation of prototype systems under realistic
conditions, and yet deploying a a prototype in a production network is
difficult without first demonstrating the value.  The GENI initiative
at the U.S. National Science Foundation aims to break this cycle by
providing the networking research community with a controlled and
realistic environment to evaluate new network architectures.  This
talk will provide an overview of GENI and its three main
features---virtualization, programmability, and user opt-in---as well
as the current thinking about the design of the various components.

<h3>Speaker Bio</h3>
<p>
Jennifer Rexford joined the Network Systems Group of the Computer Science
Department at Princeton University in February 2005 after spending
eight and a half years at AT&T Research. Her research focuses on
Internet routing, network measurement, and network management, with
the larger goal of making data networks easier to design, understand,
and manage. Jennifer is co-author of the book Web Protocols and
Practice: HTTP/1.1, Networking Protocols, Caching, and Traffic
Measurement (Addison-Wesley, May 2001) and co-editor of She's an
Engineer? Princeton Alumnae Reflect (Princeton University,
1993). Jennifer serves as the chair of ACM SIGCOMM, and as a member of
the ACM Council and the CRA Board of Directors. She received her BSE
degree in electrical engineering from Princeton University in 1991,
and her MSE and PhD degrees in computer science and electrical
engineering from the U. Michigan in 1993 and 1996, respectively.
