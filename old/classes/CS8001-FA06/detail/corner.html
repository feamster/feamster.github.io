<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Disruption Tolerant Networks rely on intermittent contacts between
mobile nodes to deliver packets using a store-carry-and-forward
paradigm.  In this talk, I will present a few results from a
UMass-GaTach collaboration to study Disruption Tolerant Networks.  We
have recently constructed a large-scale DTN, called UMassDieselNet,
that runs on a network of 40 busses covering a 120 square mile area.
While a number of projects have emerged from this testbed, I will
focus on capacity building, and if time permits, on robustness.</p>

<p>The performance of DTNs can be improved through careful capacity
building.  We propose the use of throwbox nodes, which are stationary,
battery powered nodes with storage and processing, to enhance the
capacity of DTNs.  However, the use of throwboxes without efficient
power management is minimally effective. If the nodes are too liberal
with their energy consumption, they will fail prematurely. However if
they are too conservative, they may miss important transfer
opportunities, hence increasing lifetime without improving
performance.  I will present a hardware and software architecture for
energy efficient throwboxes in DTNs.  We propose a hardware platform
that uses a multi-tiered, multi-radio, scalable, solar powered
platform.  Through trace-driven simulations and prototype deployment
we show that a single throwbox with a small-sized solar panel can run
perpetually while improving packet delivery by 37\% and reducing
message delivery latency by at least 10\% in the network.</p>

<p>If time permits, I will also cover our recent efforts in measuring the
robustness of DTNs to attack.  Just as in traditional networks,
malicious nodes within a DTN may attempt to delay or destroy data in
transit to its destination. Such attacks include dropping data,
flooding the network with extra messages, corrupting routing tables,
and counterfeiting network acknowledgments.  We conclude that
Disruption Tolerant Networks are extremely robust to attack; in our
trace-driven evaluations, an attacker that has compromised 30% of all
nodes reduces throughput by only 15% and up to 50% with knowledge of
future events.'
