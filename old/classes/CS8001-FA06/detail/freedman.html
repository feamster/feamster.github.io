<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The explosive growth in unwanted email has prompted the development of
techniques for the rejection of email, intended to shield recipients
from the onerous task of identifying the legitimate email in their
inboxes amid a sea of spam. Unfortunately, widely used content-based
filtering systems have converted the spam problem into a false
positive one: email has become unreliable. Email acceptance techniques
complement rejection ones; they can help prevent false positives by
filing email into a user's inbox before it is considered for
rejection. Whitelisting, whereby recipients accept email from some set
of authorized senders, is one such acceptance technique.</p>

<p>We present Reliable Email (RE:), a new whitelisting system that incurs
zero false positives among socially connected users. Unlike previous
whitelisting systems, which require that whitelists be populated
manually, RE: exploits friend-of-friend relationships among email
correspondents to populate whitelists automatically. To do so, RE:
permits an email's recipient to discover whether other email users
have whitelisted the email's sender, while preserving the privacy of
users' email contacts with cryptographic private matching
techniques. Using real email traces from two sites, we demonstrate
that RE: renders a significant fraction of received email
reliable. Our evaluation also shows that RE: can prevent up to 88% of
the false positives incurred by a widely deployed email rejection
system, at modest computational cost.</p>

<p>Joint work with Scott Garriss, Michael Kaminsky, Brad Karp, David
Mazieres, Antonio Nicolosi, and Haifeng Yu.
