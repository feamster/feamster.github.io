Biography: | 
  Hari Balakrishnan is a Professor in the EECS Department and
  a member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
  Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. His research interests is in the area of
  networked computer systems. His research spans overlay and
  peer-to-peer networks; Internet routing, congestion control, and
  architecture; wireless and sensor networks; network security; and
  distributed data management. In addition to many widely cited papers,
  several systems developed as part of his research are available in the
  public domain, and some are in production or commercial use (e.g., the
  Cricket location system, the RON and MONET overlay networks, the Chord
  distributed hash table, the rcc network checker, the Aurora/Medusa
  stream processing engine).

  Balakrishnan received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University
  of California at Berkeley in 1998 and a B.Tech. from the Indian
  Institute of Technology (Madras) in 1993. His honors include an Alfred
  P. Sloan Research Fellowship (2002), an NSF CAREER Award (2000), the
  ACM doctoral dissertation award for his work on TCP over wireless
  networks (1998), and several award-winning papers at various top
  conferences and journals, including the IEEE Communication Society's
  William R. Bennett Prize (2004). He has also received awards for
  excellence in teaching and research at MIT (Spira and Junior Bose
  teaching awards, and the Harold Edgerton faculty achievement award).

  In 2003, Balakrishnan co-founded StreamBase Systems, the first
  commercial stream processing engine. Between 2000 and 2003, he helped
  devise the key algorithms for Sandburst Corporation's (acquired by
  Broadcom) high-speed network QoS chipset.
