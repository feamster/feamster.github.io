<h2>Tools and Techniques for Robust and Secure Network Operations</h2>
Network operators face a daunting challenge of having to run their
networks at peak performance in the face of constantly changing
conditions and continual threats.  Unfortunately, the complexity of
network configuration, the large number of heterogeneous network
devices, and continually changing network conditions make it difficult
for operators to achieve high availability and performance while
satisfying the high-level policies (\eg, security policies) for
operations of their networks.  Today, network operators are unable to
correctly configure their networks to achieve the tasks they would like
to accomplish, they are unable to protect their networks from emerging
threads such as botnets (and botnet ``applications'', such as spam,
click fraud, etc.), and they are unable to troubleshoot their network
configurations when problems do arise.  By and large, network operators
debug faults and anomalies manually; these operators do not have
efficient, automated tools and techniques to help operators perform
proactive, predictive analysis (\eg, the effects of a change to the
network configuration, etc.).  

These problems in proactive fault detection, network security, and
reactive troubleshooting harm network availability and consume a large
amount of operator time.  Furthermore, these tasks contribute
significant costs to running networks; ISPs are becoming more
competitive, and as the cost of bandwidth drops, they must reduce the
considerable cost (in time and money) of running their networks.  One
thrust of my research is to develop tools and techniques to help network
operators (of both service provider and enterprise networks) run their
networks better: specifically, my research aims to help network
operators (1)~attain assurances of the correctness, security, and
robustness of network configurations; (2)~locate the source of problems
when the network does not behave as expected.


<h2>Facilitating Network Operations and Management with Internet
Architecture</h2> 

Today's Internet architecture imposes constraints that can make network
operations tasks staggeringly difficult.  My research helps
network operators run their networks in the context of today's Internet
routing architecture;
but also explores how the Internet architecture be
changed to facilitate better network operations. I
construe network operations somewhat broadly; in addition to tackling
problems such as helping network operators perform traffic engineering,
improve network security, and provision and deploy new services.  This
research thread incorporates work both on network architecture and
protocol design.


In addition to designing tools and techniques to help network operators
run their networks better today, within the contraints of the current
Internet infrastructure, I am also designing and implementing new
network architectures and systems that could help the network be more
inherently robust and secure.  I am investigating how a network
architecture that separates infrastructure providers (the entities that
deploy and maintain the network equipment) from service providers (the
entities that deploy network protocols and end-to-end services). This
separation allows the future Internet to support multiple simultaneous
{\em virtual networks\/}, each of which could offer multiple end-to-end
network services.
