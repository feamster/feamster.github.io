<h1>Network Security and Operations</h1>

<h2>Tools and Techniques for Robust and Secure Network Operations</h2>
Network operators face a daunting challenge of having to run their
networks at peak performance in the face of constantly changing
conditions and continual threats.  Unfortunately, the complexity of
network configuration, the large number of heterogeneous network
devices, and continually changing network conditions make it difficult
for operators to achieve high availability and performance while
satisfying the high-level policies (\eg, security policies) for
operations of their networks.  Today, network operators are unable to
correctly configure their networks to achieve the tasks they would like
to accomplish, they are unable to protect their networks from emerging
threads such as botnets (and botnet ``applications'', such as spam,
click fraud, etc.), and they are unable to troubleshoot their network
configurations when problems do arise.  By and large, network operators
debug faults and anomalies manually; these operators do not have
efficient, automated tools and techniques to help operators perform
proactive, predictive analysis (\eg, the effects of a change to the
network configuration, etc.).  

These problems in proactive fault detection, network security, and
reactive troubleshooting harm network availability and consume a large
amount of operator time.  Furthermore, these tasks contribute
significant costs to running networks; ISPs are becoming more
competitive, and as the cost of bandwidth drops, they must reduce the
considerable cost (in time and money) of running their networks.  One
thrust of my research is to develop tools and techniques to help network
operators (of both service provider and enterprise networks) run their
networks better: specifically, my research aims to help network
operators (1) attain assurances of the correctness, security, and
robustness of network configurations; and (2) locate the source of problems
when the network does not behave as expected.
