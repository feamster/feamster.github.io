<b>Problem</b><BR>
<P>
Internet routing depends on the cooperation of thousands of competing
networks called autonomous systems (ASes), each 
of which sets policy about the routes it is willing to
accept and propagate.  Routing security has two angles: (1) <em>control-plane
security</em>, which concerns protecting the authenticity of the information
carried by the routing protocol itself; and (2) <em>data-plane security</em>,
which involves providing guarantees about where traffic actually goes
(<i>i.e.</i>, whether the path it takes corresponds to the advertised
route). 
<p>
Control-plane security has been studied rather extensively, although all
practical solutions to this problem require the deployment of a
centralized public-key infrastructure or trusted third party.
Data-plane security, however, is an important (and unstudied) problem.
This project involves designing new ways to allow hosts on the Internet
to gain assurances about the paths their packets actually travel en
route to other hosts.  Can you augment today's infrastructure to provide
support for a host to prevent its packets from traveling through a
certain AS?  What changes could allow a host to get a receipt that
proved its traffic traveled along a certain path?  Can you find
solutions to these problems that are efficient enough to work at real
Internet traffic rates?

<b>Background</b><BR>
<P>
As mentioned, there is not a lot of work on data-plane security,
although parts of these two papers talk about the problem:

<p>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
Please turn in a short (less than 10 pages) writeup describing your
proposed algorithm, evaluation, and conclusion.

<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
Based on the quality of the final report.  Proposing a new algorithm and
performing "back of the envelope" running-time analysis is sufficient.
An implementation and experimental evaluation of your algorithm is better.
