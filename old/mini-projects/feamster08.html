<b>Problem</b><BR>
<P>
Internet routing, the process by which hosts construct paths to
destinations, must be highly configurable to provide scalability and
allow network operators to express flexible business policies.  In some
sense, configuring a network of routers to run a routing protocol is
like writing a large distributed program.  This configurability provides
flexibility, but also introduces complexity that can lead to errors.
<p>
Recent work has shown that analyzing the static configuration files is
surprisingly useful for detecting errors and predicting the dynamic
behavior of the Internet's routing protocol, the <em>Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP)</em>.  This project involves further exploring the types
of errors that static configuration analysis can detect.  For example,
you could investigate errors caused by the interactions between a
network's BGP and internal routing configurations (see the background
papers for more details on this problem).  You could also analyze some
other aspect of the network configuration (<i>e.g.</i>, a network's VPN
configuration).  In any case, you'll be finding errors in the
configurations of operational networks.
<p>
<b>Background</b><BR>
<P>
You'll likely find these papers useful.  The first one, on <em>rcc</em>,
is particularly relevant, as it describes the tool that performs static
analysis on BGP configurations.

You'll want to have a look at the <em>rcc</em> code, available <a
href=http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/rcc/>here</a>. 
You'll also want to contact me to gain access to the router
configuration files on which you can test your code (and hopefully find
some errors!).
<p>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
Your additions to the <i>rcc</i> codebase, and a short (less than
5-page) writeup describing your analysis of errors in real-world router
configurations. 
<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
Based on the quality of your analysis.  Finding errors
makes for excellent results, but developing sound checks is more important!
