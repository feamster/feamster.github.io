<b>Problem</b><P>

The Internet is composed of independently operated networks called
<em>Autonomous Systems</em>, or "ASes" (Georgia Tech is an example of an
AS; your home broadband provider is another).  The conenctions
relationships between these ASes collectively form a network we know as
the Internet.  Studying how this AS-level graph evolves can provide
insight into why a network exhibits a certain structure.
<p>
Previous work has observed that the Internet's AS-level graph exhibits
"power law" characteristics.  Subsequent work mildly debunked this by
suggesting that the power-law characteristics were artifacts of
measurement, and that, in any case, describing a topology as "power law"
is not evocative: it doesn't describe <em>why</em> a graph exhibits a
certain structure in the first place.  While people have studied 
<p>
In this project, you will study the <em>evolution</em> of the AS graph
over time.  Where are new links forming and old links disappearing?
Does the appearance or disappearance of these links suggest anything
about how relationships on the Internet are changing (e.g., are there
more links between ASes at the edge of the graph)?  Is there a rhyme or
reason to how links appear and disappear?  Can you model it somehow?

<!-- Evolution of the AS graph --- changes at edges or in the core?  can you
characterise?  Apply this knowledge to the prior topology studies.
Which models are "evocative"? (cf. shenker paper that debunks power law
stuff) i.e., does the power law topology arise due to preferential
attachment, etc., or is it just coincidence? -->

<b>Background</b><P>

The following papers may be useful starting points.

Several places keep historical archives of routing table dumps.  These
will be useful for constructing the AS-level graph at various times:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://bgp.lcs.mit.edu/>BGP Monitor at MIT</a>
<li><a href=http://www.route-views.org>Oregon RouteViews Project</a>
<li><a href=http://www.ripe.net/projects/ris/rawdata.html>RIPE</a>
<li><a
href=http://abilene.internet2.edu/observatory/data-collections.html>Abilene</a>
</ul>
<p>
I also have some code that you may find useful for parsing the routing
tables and inserting the AS adjacencies into a database.

<P>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
This project is indended as a measurement study.  Please turn in a short
(less than 10 pages) writeup describing your measurement techniques,
results, and observations about the evolution of the AS graph.

<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
Based on the quality of the final report.  A reasonable evaluation of
the graph evolution over a decent period of time (e.g., a few years) is
sufficient.  Taking a stab at a model is icing on the cake.
