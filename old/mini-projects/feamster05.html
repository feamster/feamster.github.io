<b>Problem</b><BR>
<P>
While all of us are victims of spam (<i>e.g.</i>, unsolicited commercial
email), little is known about the processes and infrastructure that
spammers use.  
<p>
For example, it is widely believed that spammers use large groups
of compromised hosts ("botnets") from which to send spam.  How large are
these botnets, and how many distinct botnets can you detect?  Do
different sets of spammers share this infrastructure?  Others have
claimed (and I have some preliminary evidence to suggest) that some
spammers temporarily steal ("hijack") IP address space from which to
send spam.   What other techniques can you detect?  Can you apply your
findings to automatically detect spam techniques in real time?

<p>
<b>Background</b><BR>
<P>
The popular press has quite a few reports of spamming techniques.
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.mailavenger.org>MailAvenger</a>: the mail server
that is running the spam "honeypot" at MIT.  The server is 
configurable: for example, we have configured it to run traceroutes to
the mail relays, perform passive OS fingerprinting and DNS blacklist
lookups, etc. at the time the spam is received.  We can extend it to
collect other data that might be helpful in your study.
<li><a href=http://www.spamhaus.org/>SpamHaus</a>: an organization that
keeps track of spammers.
<li><a href=http://www.waltdnes.org/spam/>Coordinated Spamming</a>
<li><a href=http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/~jyjung/spam-stats/>Spam Statistics
at MIT</a> 
</ul>
You may also find <a

<p>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
A short (less than 10-page) writeup describing your findings.  
You may also choose to incorporate your findings into a spam detection
algorithm (<i>e.g.</i>, MailAvenger, SpamAssassin). 

<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
A report describing your findings is sufficient.  
Incorporating your
techniques into existing spam detection software and demonstrating that
your techniques could be effective in detecting spam is even better.
