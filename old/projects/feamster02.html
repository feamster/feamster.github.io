<b>Problem</b><BR>
<P>
Locating hosts on the Internet is a useful for many descributed
systems. For example, accurate location information helps solve the
server selection problem (e.g., determining which server replica is
closest to a client, etc.).  One commonly used approach for solving the
network location problem is to <i>embed</i> the Internet in a coordinate
space.  Many attempts have been made to map large vectors of Internet
latency measurements into a multidimensional coordinate space.  
<p>
However, mapping hosts to a coordinate space also requires that some
subset of paths satisfy the <i>triangle inequality</i>: that is, the
latency of the direct path between two hosts is less than the latency
between those hosts via an intermediate node.  In other words, the
effectiveness of these techniques ultimately depends on the triangle
inequality being satisfied much of the time.  Your task is to examine
the extent to which the triangle inequality holds on Internet paths,
using previously collected probing data from the RON testbed.  You could
start by answering a simple question such as: do paths on the Internet2
(i.e., between hosts at research institutions) satisfy the triangle
inequality more than those on the "wild" Internet?

<b>Background</b><BR>
<P>
The following papers provide some context, so you will probably want to
read them, although they are not strictly necessary to do the work for
this project:

You'll also want to contact me to get access to the RON testbed data.
If you like, we can get you an account on the testbed so that you can
also conduct additional measurements.

<p>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
Please turn in a short (less than 10 pages) writeup describing your
measurement techniques, results, and conclusions.  
<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
Based on the quality of the final report.  Analysis of existing data is
sufficient.  Conducting a new set of experiments for comparison is better.
