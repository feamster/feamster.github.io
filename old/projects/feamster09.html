<b>Problem</b><BR>
<P>
Configuring a network of routers to run a routing protocol is like
writing a large distributed program.  Unfortunately, unlike programmers,
network operators have few tools that make routing configuration easier.
In particular, operators much configure each router separately, rather
than configuring the network as a whole.  This project gives you
opportunities to explore how an alternate "programming model" could help
reduce the complexity of routing configuration.
<p>
Recent work on the <i>Routing Control Platform (RCP)</i> advocates that
each independently operated network have a logically centralized point
that controls the routes that routers ultimately select.  Could RCP also
be used as a point from which a network of routers is configured?  For
example, much of a router's configuration is replicated exactly across
every router, or modified only slightly.  Can you design techniques that
automtically recognized these "design patterns" and help a network
operator reduce this repeated effort?
<p>
<b>Background</b><BR>
<P>
The following paper provides some background on RCP and suggests the
possibility of using the RCP as a configuration system:
<ul>
<li> N. Feamster, J. Rexford, A. Shaikh, J. van der Merwe<br>
<b><a href=http://nms.lcs.mit.edu/papers/index.php?detail=5>The Case for
Separating Routing from Routers</a></b><br> 
<em>ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Future Directions in Network
Architecture</em>,
August 2004.
</ul>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
The deliverables here are fairly open-ended and you are welcome to
suggest your own.  One possibility might be for you to perform a
complexity analysis of routing configuration, and see how various
techniques (<i>e.g.</i>, clustering) could help reduce complexity.  
<p>
In
any case, a short writeup (less than 10-pages) describing the problem
you tackled and a description of your proposed techniques for reducing
router complexity and how they might be used in practice to simplify
configuration is sufficient.
<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
Based on the quality of the final report.
