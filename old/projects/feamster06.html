<b>Problem</b><BR>
<P>
The size of the Internet's routing table (<i>i.e.</i>, the list of IP
prefixes for all destinations on the Internet) is increasing rapidly.
In the span of just a few years, the size of this table has nearly
doubled.  Much of the cause of this growth is that ASes (<i>i.e.</i>,
independently operated networks) at the edge of the network are
increasingly buying service from multiple providers (a practice called
<em>multihoming</em>) and advertising IP prefixes that refer to more
specific portions of their networks.
<p>
Unfortunately, these more specific prefixes take up additional space in
the routing table.  To save space, some ASes may "aggregate" a more
specific prefix if it is contained within another prefix for which it
already has a route.  This process of aggregation saves space in the
routing tables, but it can interfere with the edge ISPs ability to
control the path that traffic takes en route to its network.
<p>
Your project could involve measurement, theoretical analysis, or both.
For example, you could perform a measurement study to answer one or more
of the following questions:
<ol>
<li> How often do edge ASes advertise more specific prefixes in an
attempt to control inbound traffic?
<li> How often are an edge AS's prefixes aggregated by
other ASes? How often does this practice affect traffic flow?
</ol>
<p>
It turns out that traffic could follow the intended paths if only some
subset of the ISPs carried the more specific routing information.  Can
you determine, from the Internet's AS-level graph, who needs to carry
the more specific prefixes, and the conditions under which they might be
willing to do so?
<p>
<b>Background</b><BR>
<P>
There hasn't been much study of aggregation in previous work, but you
may be interested in reading the following Internet draft, which
explains the problem above in more detail.  The second paper below gives
a little more background on instances where some IP prefixes may be
rather unspecific.

</ul>
Extending the latter paper is also a reasonable direction, if that
interests you.
<p>
<b>Deliverables</b><BR>
<P>
A short (less than 10-page) writeup describing your findings.
<p>
<b>Evaluation</b><BR>
<P>
Based on the quality of the final report.  Performing a reasonable
measurement study is sufficient.
