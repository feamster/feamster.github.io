                    <p>
                    Nick Feamster is Neubauer Professor of Computer Science and
                    the Director of Research at the Data Science Institute at
                    the University of Chicago.  Previously, he was a full
                    professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton
                    University, where he directed the Center for Information
                    Technology Policy (CITP); prior to Princeton, he was a full
                    professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia
                    Tech. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    His research focuses
                    on many aspects of computer networking and networked
                    systems, with a focus on network operations, network
                    security, and censorship-resistant communication systems.
				    He received his Ph.D. in Computer science from MIT
					in 2005, and his S.B. and M.Eng. degrees in Electrical
					Engineering and Computer Science from MIT in 2000 and
					2001, respectively. He was an early-stage employee at
					Looksmart (acquired by AltaVista), where he wrote the
					company's first web crawler; and at Damballa, where he
					helped design the company's first botnet-detection algorithm.
                    </p>
					
					<p> 
                    Nick is an ACM Fellow. He received the Presidential Early
                    Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) for his
                    contributions to cybersecurity, notably spam filtering. His
                    other honors include the Technology Review 35 "Top Young
                    Innovators Under 35" award, the ACM SIGCOMM Rising Star
                    Award, a Sloan Research Fellowship, the NSF CAREER award,
                    the IBM Faculty Fellowship, the IRTF Applied Networking
                    Research Prize, and award papers at ACM SIGCOMM
                    (network-level behavior of spammers), the SIGCOMM Internet
                    Measurement Conference (measuring Web performance
                    bottlenecks), and award papers at USENIX Security
                    (circumventing web censorship using Infranet, web cookie
                    analysis) and USENIX Networked Systems Design and
                    Implementation (fault detection in router configuration,
                    software-defined networking). His seminal work on the
                    Routing Control Platform won the USENIX Test of Time Award
                    for its influence on Software Defined Networking.  
                    </p>

					<p>
					Nick is an avid distance runner, having completed more than
					20 marathons, including Boston, New York, and Chicago, as
					well as the Comrades Marathon, an iconic ultra-marathon in South Africa. 
					He lives in Chicago, Illinois.
